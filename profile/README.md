**Hobby Linux. Make More.**

Hobby Linux is a tiny GNU/Linux distribution that is designed to be simple and functional for you to focus on your projects and hobbies.

⚠️ As of March 2024, Hobby Linux is in a **pre-alpha** state. Any tools found in the repos will likely hurt you so do not use them on production systems!

Hobby Linux is a passion project of [Egee](https://egee.xyz/)'s. After using Linux for many years, he became jaded with the state of Linux and decided to start his own Linux distribution (as one does).

The goal of Hobby Linux is to provide a small installed GNU/Linux operating system with custom tools and user experience focused on producitivity and minimizing inefficiencies in the workflow.

The development and philosphy of Hobby Linux largely follows practices established by [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_values) and [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing#Key_principles_and_waste).
