**HobbyLinux. Make More.**

~~⚠️ As of March 2024, HobbyLinux is in a **pre-alpha** state. Tools found in the repos may hurt you so do not use on production systems!~~

⚠️ As of May 2024, HobbyLinux has moved out of pre-alpha and has become an Egee.io project! Follow the development in the HobbyLinux monorepo [here](https://github.com/Egeeio/hobbylinux).

HobbyLinux is a tiny GNU/Linux distribution that is designed to be simple yet functional.

The goal of HobbyLinux is to build a small Linux operating system for hobbyists complete with custom tooling and a user experience focused on maximizing productivity whilst minimizing inefficiencies in the workflow.

The development philosophy of HobbyLinux is largely based on practices established by [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_values) and [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing#Key_principles_and_waste).
