**Hobby Linux. Make More.**

⚠️ As of March 2024, Hobby Linux is in a **pre-alpha** state. Tools found in the repos may hurt you so do not use on production systems!

Hobby Linux is a tiny GNU/Linux distribution that is designed to be simple and functional. It is a passion project of [Egee](https://egee.xyz/)'s. After using Linux for many years, he became jaded and decided to start his own Linux distribution (as one does).

The goal of Hobby Linux is to build a small Linux operating system for hobbyists complete with custom tooling and a user experience focused on maximizing productivity whilst minimizing inefficiencies in the workflow.

The development philosophy of Hobby Linux is largely based on practices established by [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_values) and [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing#Key_principles_and_waste).
